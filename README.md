JIRA Authentication
https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/

Getting your API token
API tokens are the the recommended method for using basic auth. You can generate an API token for your Atlassian account and use it to authenticate anywhere where you would have used a password. This enhances security because you are not saving your primary account password outside of where you authenticate, you can quickly revoke individual API tokens on a per-use basis, and API tokens will allow you to authenticate even if your Atlassian Cloud organization has two-factor authentication or SAML enabled.
